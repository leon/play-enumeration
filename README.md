# Scala Enumerations for Play Framework 2
This plugin makes it possible to use Scala's Enumerations across Play Framework 2

> Note! I don't think Scala's enumerations are any good. There are other constructs such as case classes that are better suited.
> But I'm keeping this package around for those i choose to go with it anyway :)
